## Overview :point_left:

In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will I learn?

###### After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process

- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions

- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use

- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis

- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code

- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently

- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
